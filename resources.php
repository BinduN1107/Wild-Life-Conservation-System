To help combat the decline, the International Black Rhino Foundation was founded in 1989. The IBRF worked with both in-situ conservation (protecting animals in their native habitat) and ex-situ conservation (protecting animals "off-site" such as in zoos or non-native nature reserves).<br>Learn more at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Rhino_Foundation">wikipedia</a><br>Help them and save them <a href="https://www.savetherhino.org/get-involved/donate/?gclid=CjwKCAjwgISIBhBfEiwALE19SfvhfVQshTOxgBZaao7bvYtY-Kr13oGQbx0oFuxkhM0xifZFp7qd5xoCWowQAvD_BwE">Click Here...</a></p>

STC was incorporated,based on an earlier informal organization known as The Brotherhood of the Green Turtle,in 1959 by Joshua B. Powers in response to renowned ecologist Dr. Archie Carr's award-winning book, The Windward Road,which first alerted the world to the plight of sea turtles. Carr served as Scientific Director of STC from 1959 until his death in 1987. Since its founding, STC's research and conservation initiatives have been instrumental in saving the Caribbean green sea turtle from immediate extinction, as well as raising awareness and protection for sea turtles across the globe with 50 years of experience in national and international sea turtle conservation, research and educational endeavors.The organization began its work in Costa Rica,but has expanded its research and conservation efforts throughout Central America and the wider Caribbean.<br> Learn more at <a href="https://www.conserveturtles.org/">wikipedia</a><br> Stretch a hand for turtles safety.. <a href="https://aquariumfoundation.org.za/donate-to-conservation/?gclid=CjwKCAjwgISIBhBfEiwALE19SZp1qP9CXom4l0weEnf-ACqcMuNO7k5fEZRuYQeTnXD8Zp_1slReURoC1mMQAvD_B ">click here...</a></p>

ALTA operates across Northeast Asia under the guiding principle that only co-operative, co-ordinated conservation actions from all interested parties can save these endangered species from extinction. ALTA works in close co-operation with local, regional, and federal government and non-government organisations to protect the region's biological wealth through conservation, sustainable development, and local community involvement. The Phoenix Fund and the Wildlife Conservation Society provide a local framework for implementing ALTA projects, working closely with many Russian and Chinese agencies. With regard to conservation of leopards, ALTA aims at retaining a leopard population of 35 adult females (100 total) in south-west Primorye and the Jilin-Heilongjiang border region; and creating a second population of 20 adult females (60 total) in the former range of the leopard.<br>Learn more at:<a href="https://conservewildcats.org/">wikipedia</a><br>

This database includes results from aerial surveys, dung counts, interviews with local people and data on poaching.In 1989, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora listed the African elephant on CITES. This listing banned international trade of African elephants and their body parts by countries that signed the CITES agreement. Hunting elephants is banned in the Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Côte d'Ivoire,and Senegal. After the ban came into force in 1990, retail sales of ivory carvings in South Africa have plummeted by more than 95% within 10 years. As a result of the trade ban, African elephant populations recovered in Southern African range countries.<br>Learn more at <a href="https://www.awf.org/">Wikipedia</a><br>

Enforcement, though, is the responsibility of individual countries. While some international trade for dolphinarium animals may have occurred, this is unlikely to have ever been a major threat to the species.Some Irrawaddy dolphin populations are classified by the IUCN as critically endangered; in Lao PDR, Cambodia, Viet Nam (Mekong River sub-population), Indonesia (Mahakam River sub-population, Borneo), Myanmar (Ayeyarwady/Irrawaddy River sub-population), the Philippines (Malampaya Sound sub-population), and Thailand (Songkhla Lake sub-population). Irrawaddy dolphins in general however, are IUCN listed as an Endangered species, which applies throughout their whole range. In 2004, CITES transferred the Irrawaddy dolphin from Appendix II to Appendix I, which forbids all commercial trade in species that are threatened with extinction.<br>Learn more at:<a href="https://cites.org/eng/disc/what.php">wikipedia</a><br>

These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. With its strong scientific base, the IUCN Red List is recognized as the most authoritative guide to the status of biological diversity.
